# RESTful instant messaging API

Using Java along with RabbitMQ and the springboot framework, I developed an instant messaging service that was capable of using reverse geocoding to take a given location and return the wheather conditions. The API would be capable sending and recieving JSON messages with the locations name, and wheather conditions for the data given. The API was hosted using Azure and allowed multiple clients to communicate with each other and plan travel oppurtunities together. This API also came with clients developed in both Python and Java to show the interoperability of cloud computing.
